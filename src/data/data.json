They claim that Bondi did this because of a conflict of interest, saying that she maintains a professional relationship and financial ties with Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm that has connections to United Health Group. \n\nAdditionally, Bondi's public, prejudicial statements could have influenced the grand jury, so the defense argues that the proper remedy is to throw out the government's Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty entirely. Although the government says there is no proof of bias, the defense claims that the government failed to screen grand jurors about exposure to the Attorney General's comments. They also argue that the repeated prejudicial remarks were part of a deliberate effort to shape the case and promote a tougher death penalty policy-one of the goals of the Trump administration. \n\nAs a result, the defense is asking for records and testimony about Pam Bondi's financial connections to Ballard Partners. Lastly, they ask if the judge finds Bondi's comments prejudicial, that the possibility for the death penalty be taken off the table.",

They say that they are not going to rely on an inventory search or inevitible discovery to justify reviewing the contents of Mangione's personal notebook writings, but instead rely on the valid search warrant that authorized the search of handwritten notes. Any challenge to the warrant was not properly raised and would fail since the warrant was supported by probable cause. Because of this, the prosecution believes that the court can decde on the suppression motion without holding an evidentiary hearing.",

      "content":"Mangione appears in a federal court hearing regarding counts three and four (interstate stalking resulting in death and murder with a firearm). The defense argues that those charges, which carry the death penalty, should be thrown out; however, Judge Margaret Garnett declined to decide on that during the hearing. Instead, she will issue a written decision on the Motions to Dismiss counts three and four. How these counts get treated will decide the course of the trial. Jury selection will be in September 2026. If the death penalty stays on the table, the trial will begin January 2027 (the defense requests in this instance, that jury selection be in January 2027 instead of September 2026). If the death-eligible counts are dropped, the trial can begin in October 2026.\n\nJudge Garnett rules that Altoona police acted lawfully during their seizure of Mangione's items in McDonalds. She says that officers must secure personal property during a public arrest.\n\nWhether or not there will be an evidentiary hearing is still undecided, though Judge Garnett does not believe it is necessary. Additionally, she makes no rulings on suppressions at this time.\n\nMangione's newest member of counsel, Paresh Patel said that the interstate stalking charge should not qualify for death penalty eligibility because it does not meet the legal definition of a \"crime of violence,\" as outlined in their January 7th Motion. Both the defense and prosecution agreed that \"resulting in death\" is what makes a crime violent. Judge Garnett asks the prosecution if they believe that they are able to prove the staking charge as a stand-alone count. The prosecution says they would not be able to. Judge Garnett also notes that the prosecution's arguments were broad.\n\nCourt will continue on January 30th.",

Supporting their argument, in United States v. Gomez, the court ruled that a California assult law was not a violent crime because it could be violated without the intention of hurting someone or done without knowing that harm would for certain happen. The defense is saying that stalking and cyberstalking laws work in the same manner. Stalking laws punish actions that cause fear whether or not that was the intention of the supposed stalker. Because of this, stalking and cyberstalking cannot be considered a \"violent crime.\"",

To rebut this, the government is saying that Gomez was a state assult case, not one of federal stalking, thus making it irrelevant to this case.
